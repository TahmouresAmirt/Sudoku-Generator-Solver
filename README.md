### About Sudoku Puzzle 
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. It's a challenging and entertaining brain teaser loved by many.

### Repository Overview 
This repository contains code that utilizes a genetic algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles in two stages:

1. **Stage 1**: The genetic algorithm attempts to find a solvable Sudoku puzzle by exploring different solutions.
  
2. **Stage 2**: Building on the first stage, the genetic algorithm incorporates a defined fitness function to effectively solve the Sudoku puzzle and generate a 9x9 Sudoku grid. In this stage, the genetic algorithm adapts to variable chromosome lengths to successfully reach the solution. While the first genetic algorithm phase searches for potential solutions without hitting the solution point, the second genetic algorithm phase employs a distinct approach by adjusting the chromosome length to efficiently arrive at the solution.
